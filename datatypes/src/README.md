Integers 
 **************************

There are different types of data structures , espcecially scalar types. These scalar types are integers, floating point numbers, booleans and characters.

Integers are whole numbers and they can either be signed or unsigned.

Signed numbers indicates that a number has a plus or minus sign so they either positive or  negative numbers. They can store values from 
(2 ^ n-1) to 2 ^ n-1 -1 . Given a 8bit signed number , you can have values from 128 - 127

Unsigned number have no sign and are always positive. They can store values from 0 to  2 ^ n-1 . Given an unsigned 8bit integer they can store numbers from 0 -255.

Rust does type inference as assigns a default i32 type if you dont set a type for your variable. It is also generally fast


Floating-Point 

***********

The types are f32 and f64. The default type is f64 



Booleans
***********

They either have a value of true or false and its specified using the keyword bool. It is 1 byte in size and are used in control and conditional statement.


Characters
**********

They represent letters and are specified using the char keyword and use single quotes. They are 4 bytes in size
