We can learn how to compound data types in rust. Some compound data types are Arrays,Tuples

Arrays -  There are a continuous groups of items 
        - There are of fixed lengths
        - Their lengths are known at compile time
        - They are heterogeneous - Meaning they contain only items of a same data type.

Example : let first_item = array[12] or let array: [u32; 3] =  [1,3,4]

Tuples - There are a continuous group of items
        - There are of fixed lengths
        - Their length are known of compile time
        - They are homogenous- Their items can be of different types
        - The empty tuple is called unit
        - 

Example : let tuple = (true, 2,3)
